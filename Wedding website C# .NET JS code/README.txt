This folder contains code from my project ‘Happily Ever After’.

Brief description of the project: The project is a website that serves as a one stop solution
for someone who is planning a wedding. There are different features like a wedding shop, a photo
gallery, and a feature to find wedding dress shops around your location. 

There are 4 subfolders inside this folder:

1. ASPX - This folder contains all the aspx files that I used for the website. I have used a master
	  page to create a consistent template for all the pages on the website. 


2. C# - This folder contains two C# files, both of which contain methods for fetching data from Amazon
	API, parsing the XML response and displaying it on my website


3. Javascript - This folder contains the javascript code used for implementing the photo gallery feature
		by fetching data from Flickr API, and directions feature by fetching data from Google
		Places API.

4. CSS - This folder contains the stylesheet for each page of the website, as well as a stylesheet for the 
	 master page.
